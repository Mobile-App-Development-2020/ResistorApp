# ResistorApp

Android Studio Mini-Project for Third Year Mobile App Development Semester 1. 

The project allows you to select the the colours on a four band resistor and then calculate the resistance in Ohms (Î©) that resistor provides.

** NOTE ** I have added an MP4 file called WATCH_ME.mp4 for viewers interested in seeing the app function.
